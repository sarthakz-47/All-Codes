## About
This repository is my personal coding journal where I upload code I write daily.  
It includes everything from basic to advanced DSA concepts, solutions to DSA problems, small academic projects, web experiments, and anything I learn while coding.

## Languages & Technologies
- **Java** – for DSA problems, algorithms, patterns, and LeetCode practice  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – for web development learning and project building  
- **VS Code** – my main editor for coding

## How to Use
You can explore my daily code files to see examples and learn along.  
Each file or folder represents a piece of code I wrote on a particular day.  

For example, to run a Java program:

```bash
# Navigate to the folder containing the file
javac Example.java
java Example
```

For HTML/JS files, simply open them in a browser.
