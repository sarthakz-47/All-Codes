        // Arrays is a data strucute which consists list of elements of same type
        // and placed in contigeous memory locaton

        // List of same elements means?
        // it can consists elemtns of one data type
        // like int = [1,23,43] , char = ['a','v','c']

        // Contigeous memeory location means?
        // for ex: int array = [1,2,3]
        // then they are stored in memory location adjacantly
        // if 1 is placed at memory location 1002 then 2 is placed at 1006 (+4 bytes)
        // this is called contigeous memory location.

        // lets create a simple array:
        // int numbers[] = { 100, 300, 500 };
    }
